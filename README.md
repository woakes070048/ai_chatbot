## Features

### Chat Interface
- Modern single-page chat UI built with Vue 3, Vite, and Tailwind CSS
- Sidebar with conversation history, provider switcher, and dark mode toggle
- Fresh new chat with enabled input on every load
- Responsive layout (desktop and mobile)
- Markdown rendering (marked.js) with syntax highlighting (highlight.js)
- Apache ECharts for inline chart rendering (bar, line, pie, stacked, horizontal bar)
- PDF export of individual messages or full conversations
- File upload with LLM Vision API support (images, PDFs)
- Voice input/output (speech-to-text, text-to-speech)

### AI Providers
- OpenAI: GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4-Turbo, GPT-3.5-Turbo
- Anthropic Claude: Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5
- Google Gemini
- Switch providers on the fly from the sidebar

### Real-Time Streaming
- Token-by-token streaming via Frappe Realtime (Socket.IO / WebSocket)
- Typing indicator while the AI is generating a response

### Multi-Company and Multi-Currency
- Every tool accepts a `company` parameter (defaults to the user's default company)
- Monetary aggregations use `base_*` fields for company-currency consistency
- Cross-company consolidated reports for group-level analysis
- Per-conversation target currency selection
- Include-subsidiaries toggle for automatic child company inclusion

### Consolidation
- Parent company detection, cross-subsidiary aggregation with currency conversion

### Permissions
- DocType-based tool filtering — users only see tools they have access to

### Financial Analyst
- CFO-grade analysis behaviour when finance tools are enabled
- CFO dashboard returns styled metric cards with YoY change percentages (Revenue, Net Profit, Cash, AR, AP)
- Finance tools support **Accounting Dimensions** filtering
- Hierarchical grouping by territory, customer_group, customer, item_group, accounting_dimensions, department with period columns (monthly/quarterly/yearly)
- Trial balance, GL summary, account statement — authoritative accounting data from GL entries
- Frontend renders indented data tables with group headers, subtotals, and bold formatting

### Voice Communication
- Speech-to-text input (Web Speech API) and text-to-speech output (SpeechSynthesis)
- User defined voice output language in **Chabot Settings**
- **Auto-speak:** When user submits via voice, AI response auto-speaks after streaming completes
- **Manual "Listen" button** on all assistant messages (Volume2/VolumeX icons)

### Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)
Extract structured data from uploaded documents (invoices, POs, receipts, quotations) using LLM Vision/text extraction and ERPNext schema discovery. Map non-uniform, multi-language source data to ERPNext DocType schemas with semantic reasoning. Create records and compare documents against existing ERPNext records.
- LLM performs semantic reasoning to identify which source values map to which ERPNext fields
- Schema mapping resolves naming discrepancies between source document fields and ERPNext DocType structure
- Supported DocTypes: Sales Invoice, Purchase Invoice, Quotation, Sales Order, Purchase Order, Delivery Note, Purchase Receipt
- **Output Language** (default: English) — document can be in any language; extracted values are translated. System prompt instructs the LLM to translate text values (item descriptions, terms, remarks, party names) to the target language while preserving numbers, dates, currency codes, and proper nouns

### Auto Email & Scheduled Reports
- AI-generated scheduled reports delivered via email on configurable schedules.
- **PDF** attachment with tables and charts.

### PDF Export from Chat
- User can export any AI chatbot response (including tables and charts) as a downloadable PDF directly from the chat interface. Both single-message and full-conversation exports are supported.

## Usage

After setup, open the chatbot at:

```
https://<your-site>/ai-chatbot
```

Type natural-language questions about your business data. Examples:

| Prompt | Output Type |
|--------|-------------|
| Show top 10 customers by revenue this year | Table |
| Sales trend month by month for this fiscal year | Chart |
| What are our outstanding receivables? | Table |
| What is the current cash balance? | Number |
| Show expense breakdown by cost center | Chart |
| Create a new Lead for John Doe from Acme Corp | Record creation |
| Compare sales this month vs last month | Table |
| Show CFO dashboard | BI dashboard with cards |
| Forecast revenue for next 3 months | Chart with confidence intervals |
| Extract data from this invoice | Document processing |

Charts are rendered with Apache ECharts. The backend returns `echart_option` objects; the frontend renders them inline in the chat.

See [docs/SAMPLE_USER_PROMPT.md](docs/SAMPLE_USER_PROMPT.md) for 80+ sample prompts organized by category.

## @Mention System

Type `@` in the chat input to insert contextual filters. Mentions are resolved to actual ERPNext values before being sent to the AI.

| Mention | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `@company` | Filter by company | `@company:Acme Inc` |
| `@period` | Set date range | `@period:this quarter` |
| `@cost_center` | Filter by cost center | `@cost_center:Main` |
| `@department` | Filter by department | `@department:Sales` |
| `@warehouse` | Filter by warehouse | `@warehouse:Stores - A` |
| `@customer` | Filter by customer | `@customer:John Doe` |
| `@item` | Filter by item | `@item:Widget A` |
| `@accounting_dimension` | Filter by custom dimension | `@accounting_dimension:Project X` |

## Tool Plugin System

External Frappe apps can register custom tools with the chatbot without modifying this app.

### 1. Create a tool module in your app

```python
# my_app/chatbot_tools/manufacturing.py

from ai_chatbot.tools.registry import register_tool

@register_tool(
    name="get_production_summary",
    category="manufacturing",
    description="Get production order summary for a date range",
    parameters={
        "from_date": {"type": "string", "description": "Start date (YYYY-MM-DD)"},
        "to_date": {"type": "string", "description": "End date (YYYY-MM-DD)"},
        "company": {"type": "string", "description": "Company name"},
    },
    doctypes=["Work Order"],
)
def get_production_summary(from_date=None, to_date=None, company=None):
    # Your implementation here
    ...
```

### 2. Register the module in your app's hooks.py

```python
# my_app/hooks.py

ai_chatbot_tool_modules = ["my_app.chatbot_tools.manufacturing"]
```

### 3. Optionally register a new category

If you want your tools grouped under a new category with a toggle in Chatbot Settings:

```python
from ai_chatbot.tools.registry import register_tool_category

register_tool_category("manufacturing", settings_field=None)
# Pass settings_field="enable_manufacturing_tools" if you add
# a corresponding checkbox to Chatbot Settings via customize form.
# If settings_field is None, the category is always enabled.
```

The chatbot will automatically discover and load your tools at runtime. Permission checks are enforced based on the `doctypes` list declared in each tool.

## Development

### Frontend

```bash
cd apps/ai_chatbot/frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server (http://localhost:8080, proxies API to Frappe)
npm run dev

# Production build (outputs to ai_chatbot/public/frontend)
npm run build
```

### Backend

```bash
# Start Frappe development server
bench start

# Run backend tests
bench --site <your-site> run-tests --app ai_chatbot

# Linting
ruff check .
ruff format .

# Or via pre-commit
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Code Conventions

- **Python**: Tabs for indentation, 110-character line length, double quotes, type hints
- **JavaScript/Vue**: Vue 3 Composition API (`<script setup>`), Tailwind CSS
- **API pattern**: `@frappe.whitelist()` decorators, Frappe ORM (`frappe.qb` / `frappe.get_all`) for database access -- no raw SQL with string interpolation
- **Error handling**: `try/except` with `frappe.log_error()`

### Dependencies

**Python** (runtime): frappe, openai, anthropic, twilio==8.5.0, python-docx>=1.1, requests (pypdf and openpyxl provided by Frappe)

**Frontend**: vue 3, vue-router, marked, highlight.js, lucide-vue-next, tailwindcss, echarts, socket.io-client
