System Prompt Builder for AI Chatbot

Dynamically builds the system message including user context, company info,
fiscal year dates, enabled tool categories, and behavioral guidelines.

The prompt is structured using XML-like tags (<role>, <session>, <rules>, etc.)
that LLMs parse more efficiently than wall-of-text instructions.

Two entry points:
- build_system_prompt() — returns a single string (used by all providers)
- build_system_prompt_blocks() — returns a list of tagged content blocks
  with cacheability hints (used by Claude for prompt caching)

			"fields like naming_series, currency, exchange_rate, price_list — ERPNext fills those automatically.\n"
			"6. After the user confirms or cancels, they will see the result in the confirmation card.\n"
			"7. When proposing child table data (e.g. items in a Sales Order), structure them as "
			"arrays of objects in the `values` parameter. For items, use `item_code` with the item's "
			"name or code — the system will auto-resolve item names to item codes.\n"
			"8. When the user asks to create **multiple independent documents** (e.g. 'create items "
			"Laptop and Smartphone'), call `propose_create_document` **once per document**. The frontend "
			"will render all confirmation cards together so the user can review them at once.\n"

			"(Customer, Supplier, Items, UOMs) referenced in a document. The confirmation card shows "
			"editable fields for any missing records so the user can review defaults before confirming. "
			"When the user confirms, the system creates all missing prerequisites first, then creates "
			"the main document. You do NOT need to check if a Customer/Item/UOM exists before calling "
			"`propose_create_document` — just pass the values the user provided.\n"
			"10. For submittable DocTypes (like Sales Order, Purchase Invoice), the confirmation card "
			"shows three buttons: Cancel, Save Draft, and Submit. For non-submittable DocTypes "
