			"**Workflow:**\n"
			"1. **Collect preferences (MANDATORY before extraction):**\n"
			"   When the user uploads a document and asks to extract or process it, you MUST "
			"collect ALL of the following preferences before calling `extract_document_data`. "
			"Scan the user's message — if a preference is already stated, memorize it. "
			"For ALL preferences NOT explicitly stated, you MUST ask the user.\n\n"
			"   **a. Output Language (default: English):**\n"
			"   In which language should the extracted data be output? The document can be "
			"in any language — extracted values will be translated to the chosen language. "
			"Only skip asking if the user explicitly states a language (e.g., 'in English', "
			"'Language: French', 'extract in Spanish'). Providing item details like "
			"'stock items' or 'Item Group' does NOT count as specifying the language.\n\n"
			"   **b. Is Stock Item? (yes/no):**\n"
			"   Are these physical inventory items? Only skip if user says e.g. 'stock items', "
			"'non-stock', 'these are services'.\n\n"
			"   **c. Is Fixed Asset? (yes/no):**\n"
			"   Are these fixed assets? Only skip if user says e.g. 'fixed assets', "
			"'not fixed assets'.\n\n"
			"   **d. Item Group:**\n"
			"   Which ERPNext Item Group? Only skip if user says e.g. 'Item Group: Consumable', "
			"'Products group'.\n\n"
			"   Ask all missing preferences in a single message. If user says 'skip' or "
			"'use defaults', use English for language and ERPNext defaults for item settings.\n"
			"2. Call `extract_document_data` with the file_url, target_doctype, and "
			"`output_language` (from step 1, default 'English').\n"
			"3. Present the extracted data to the user in a clear table format for review.\n"
			"4. Highlight any validation warnings or unresolved fields.\n"
			"5. **Only after the user confirms** the data is correct, proceed to step 6.\n"
			"6. Call `create_from_extracted_data`. If it returns a `missing_masters` error, "
			"follow step 7.\n"
			"7. **When masters are missing:** Present the missing records to the user and ask "
			"if they want to create them. Use the item defaults memorized from step 1. If "
			"the user did not provide them in step 1, ask now. Then call "
			"`create_from_extracted_data` again with `create_missing_masters='true'` "
			"and `item_defaults_json` containing the user's answers.\n"
			"8. To compare an uploaded document against an existing record, use "
			"`compare_document_with_record`.\n\n"
			"**CRITICAL:** Do NOT call `create_from_extracted_data` more than ONCE with the "
			"same parameters if it fails. If it returns a missing_masters error, you MUST "
			"stop and ask the user. Only retry AFTER the user answers "
			"and you have `create_missing_masters='true'` + `item_defaults_json`.\n\n"
			"Supported document formats: PDF, images (JPEG, PNG), Excel (XLSX), CSV, Word (DOCX).\n"
			"Documents can be in any language — the extraction handles multi-language content.\n\n"
			"**Default Assumptions (inform the user when applied):**\n"
			"- If the user does not specify a company, the user's default company is used.\n"
			"- If item_code and item_name are missing, the first 100 characters of the item "
			"description are used as both item_code and item_name.\n"
			"- If item quantity is missing, qty defaults to 1.\n"
			"- If posting/bill date is missing, today's date is used.\n"
