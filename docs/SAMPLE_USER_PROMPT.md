## Tips

**Use @mentions to scope queries.** Type `@` in the chat input to see available categories: `@company`, `@period`, `@cost_center`, `@department`, `@warehouse`, `@customer`, `@item`, `@accounting_dimension`. These let you target specific companies, date ranges, or entities without typing full names. See the [AT_MENTION_GUIDE.md](AT_MENTION_GUIDE.md) for full details.

**Charts are interactive.** Prompts that return chart output render as interactive Apache ECharts visualizations. You can hover for tooltips, zoom, and pan. Charts are also included when you export a conversation to PDF.

**Results depend on your data and permissions.** The chatbot queries live ERPNext data. If a module is not installed (e.g., HRMS) or tools are disabled in Chatbot Settings, related prompts will not return results. Your user role permissions also apply -- you only see data you are authorized to access.

**Ask follow-up questions.** You can drill down into any result. For example, after seeing top customers, ask "Show sales details for the top customer" or "Break this down by item group."

**Upload documents for IDP processing.** Click the paperclip icon (or drag and drop) to attach invoices, purchase orders, receipts, or other documents. The chatbot extracts structured data using AI vision and maps it to ERPNext fields.

**Use voice input.** Click the microphone icon to dictate your prompt. The chatbot auto-sends after detecting 2 seconds of silence. Voice input works for any prompt type.

**Export conversations.** Use the download icon on any assistant message to export it as a PDF. You can also export the entire conversation from the chat header menu.

**Set your preferred language.** Use the language selector in the chat header to receive responses in Hindi, Spanish, French, German, and other supported languages.

**Combine @mentions for precision.** Use multiple @mentions in a single prompt for highly targeted queries: `@company Tara Technologies @period This Quarter -- show sales by territory`.
