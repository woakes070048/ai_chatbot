# AI Chatbot — Testing Guide

Step-by-step testing instructions for each phase of the AI Chatbot implementation.

---

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Ensure bench is running
bench start

# Site name used throughout this guide
SITE=test.local
```

Open the chatbot at:
- **With nginx**: `http://<SITE>/ai-chatbot` (recommended for production-like testing)
- **Without nginx (dev mode)**: `http://<SITE>:8005/ai-chatbot`

---

## Phase 1: Foundation — Core Framework, Data Layer & Security

### 1.1 Chatbot Settings

1. Go to **Chatbot Settings** (`/app/chatbot-settings`).
2. Verify the following fields exist:
   - **OpenAI section**: `Enable OpenAI`, `OpenAI API Key`, `OpenAI Model`, `Temperature`, `Max Tokens`
   - **Claude section**: `Enable Claude`, `Claude API Key`, `Claude Model`, `Temperature`, `Max Tokens`
   - **Tools section**: `Enable CRM Tools`, `Enable Sales Tools`, `Enable Purchase Tools`, `Enable Finance Tools`, `Enable Inventory Tools`
   - **Streaming section**: `Enable Streaming` (checkbox, default: checked)
3. Enter a valid API key for at least one provider (OpenAI or Claude).
4. Enable the corresponding provider checkbox.
5. Save.

### 1.2 Basic Chat (Non-Streaming)

1. Open the chatbot: `http://<SITE>:8005/ai-chatbot`
2. A new conversation should be auto-created.
3. Type a simple message: `Hello, who are you?`
4. **Expected**: "AI is thinking..." typing indicator appears, followed by an AI response.
5. The sidebar should show the conversation with an auto-generated title.

### 1.3 Conversation Management

1. Click **New Chat** in the sidebar — a new conversation should appear.
2. Switch between conversations — messages should load correctly.
3. Delete a conversation — it should disappear from the sidebar.

### 1.4 AI Provider Switching

1. In the chat header, switch between OpenAI and Claude (if both are configured).
2. Send a message — the response should come from the selected provider.

### 1.5 ERPNext Tool Calls

1. Ask a business question: `What is the total sales this month?`
2. **Expected**: The AI should use ERPNext tools (visible in the response as tool call indicators).
3. Try other tool-triggering questions:
   - `Show me the top 5 customers by revenue`
   - `What is the current stock level of [item name]?`
   - `List open purchase orders`

### 1.6 Multi-Company & Multi-Currency

1. If multiple companies are configured in ERPNext:
   - Ask: `What is the total revenue for [Company Name]?`
   - **Expected**: Response includes `company` and `currency` fields.
2. Verify that monetary values use `base_*` fields for company-currency amounts.

---

## Phase 2: Streaming — Frappe Realtime (Socket.IO/WebSocket)

### 2.0 Prerequisites

```bash
# Apply the new streaming field to Chatbot Settings
bench --site test.local migrate

# Rebuild frontend (if not already done)
cd apps/ai_chatbot/frontend && npm run build

# Restart bench to pick up Python changes
# (Ctrl+C on bench start, then bench start again)
bench start
```

Verify Socket.IO is running:
- Check that `socketio_port` in `sites/common_site_config.json` is set (e.g., `9005`).
- The Node.js Socket.IO server starts automatically with `bench start`.

### 2.1 Enable Streaming

1. Go to **Chatbot Settings** (`/app/chatbot-settings`).
2. Verify the **Streaming Configuration** section exists.
3. Check **Enable Streaming** (should be checked by default).
4. Save.

### 2.2 Socket.IO Connection

1. Open the chatbot: `http://<SITE>:8005/ai-chatbot`
2. Open browser DevTools → Console.
3. **Expected**: You should see `[AI Chatbot] Socket.IO connected` in the console.
4. If you see a connection error, check:
   - Is `bench start` running? (Socket.IO server needs to be up)
   - Is `socketio_port` correct in `common_site_config.json`?
   - Check browser Network tab for WebSocket connection to `/<site_name>` namespace.

### 2.3 Typing Indicator

1. Send a message: `Tell me about ERPNext`
2. **Expected**: The "AI is thinking..." typing indicator (bouncing dots) should appear immediately after sending.
3. The indicator should remain visible until the first streaming tokens arrive.

### 2.4 Token-by-Token Streaming

1. Send a message that will produce a longer response: `Explain the key features of ERPNext in detail`
2. **Expected**:
   - Typing indicator appears first (bouncing dots).
   - Text starts appearing word-by-word / chunk-by-chunk (not all at once).
   - A blinking blue cursor appears at the end of the streaming text.
   - Content renders as markdown (bold, lists, code blocks, etc.) as it streams.
3. The response should auto-scroll as new content arrives.

### 2.5 Streaming with Tool Calls

1. Ask a question that triggers tool usage: `What is the total sales amount this month?`
2. **Expected**:
   - Typing indicator appears.
   - Tool call indicator appears (spinning icon with tool name, e.g., "Sales Summary...").
   - Tool result indicator changes to a green checkmark when complete.
   - AI continues streaming its response after tool execution.
3. Try multi-tool questions: `Compare sales and purchase amounts this month`
   - **Expected**: Multiple tool call indicators appear sequentially.

### 2.6 Stop Generation

1. Send a message that will produce a long response: `Write a detailed essay about artificial intelligence`
2. While the response is streaming, click the red **Stop** button.
3. **Expected**:
   - Streaming stops immediately.
   - The partial response remains visible.
   - The input area becomes active again (Send button returns).

### 2.7 Streaming Fallback

1. Go to **Chatbot Settings** and uncheck **Enable Streaming**.
2. Save and refresh the chatbot page.
3. Send a message.
4. **Expected**: Falls back to non-streaming behavior — typing indicator shows, then complete response appears at once.
5. Re-enable streaming after testing.

### 2.8 Conversation Persistence

1. Send a streaming message and wait for it to complete.
2. Switch to another conversation and back.
3. **Expected**: The streamed message should be persisted — it loads from the database when you switch back.
4. The conversation title should auto-update based on the first message.

### 2.9 Error Handling

1. Temporarily set an invalid API key in Chatbot Settings.
2. Send a message.
3. **Expected**: An error should appear in the chat (not a silent failure).
4. Restore the correct API key.

### 2.10 Browser DevTools Verification

For deeper debugging, check these in browser DevTools:

**Console tab:**
- `[AI Chatbot] Socket.IO connected` — confirms Socket.IO is working.

**Network tab:**
- Look for a WebSocket connection to `ws://<host>:<socketio_port>/<site_name>`.
- You should see Socket.IO frames being exchanged.
- The `send_message` POST request should return quickly with `{"stream_id": "..."}`.

**Network tab — XHR filter:**
- The `send_message` POST should return almost immediately (not blocking until the AI finishes).
- The response body should contain `"success": true` and a `stream_id`.

---

## Phase 3: Data Operations (CRUD) + Fiscal Year Defaults + System Prompt

### 3.0 Prerequisites

```bash
# Apply the new settings field (enable_write_operations)
bench --site test.local migrate

# Rebuild frontend (new amber write-operation indicator)
cd apps/ai_chatbot/frontend && npm run build

# Restart bench to pick up Python changes
# (Ctrl+C on bench start, then bench start again)
bench start
```

### 3.1 Chatbot Settings — Data Operations Section

1. Go to **Chatbot Settings** (`/app/chatbot-settings`).
2. Verify a new **Data Operations** section exists between "ERPNext Tools Configuration" and "Streaming Configuration".
3. Verify the **Enable Write Operations** checkbox exists (should be **unchecked** by default).
4. Leave it unchecked for now — we'll test read-only tools first.
5. Save.

### 3.2 System Prompt — AI Persona

1. Open the chatbot: `http://<SITE>/ai-chatbot`
2. Send: `Who are you and what can you do?`
3. **Expected**: The AI should identify itself as an ERPNext business assistant (not a generic AI). It should mention it can help with business data, analytics, etc.
4. Send: `What company am I working with?`
5. **Expected**: The AI should know your company name, currency, and fiscal year — these are injected via the system prompt.

### 3.3 Fiscal Year Date Defaults

This is a key change — all date-based tools now default to the current fiscal year instead of arbitrary periods.

1. Send: `What is the total sales?` (no date mentioned)
2. **Expected**: The AI should use ERPNext tools and report sales for the **current fiscal year** (not "last 30 days" or "all time"). The response should mention the date range used (e.g., "From 2025-04-01 to 2026-03-31").
3. Send: `What is the financial summary?`
4. **Expected**: Revenue, expenses, and profit for the current fiscal year. Previously this defaulted to the last 30 days.
5. Send: `Show me top 5 customers by revenue`
6. **Expected**: Top customers for the current fiscal year.
7. Send: `What are the purchase analytics?`
8. **Expected**: Purchase data for the current fiscal year.
9. Send: `What are the lead statistics?`
10. **Expected**: Lead stats for the current fiscal year.
11. **Explicit date override**: Send: `What were the total sales in January 2026?`
12. **Expected**: The AI should use the explicit date range (2026-01-01 to 2026-01-31), not the fiscal year default.

### 3.4 Search Tools (Read-Only)

These work even with "Enable Write Operations" unchecked, because search tools are in the `operations` category but are read-only in practice. **Note**: The `operations` category must be enabled for search tools to appear. Enable "Enable Write Operations" in settings for this test, or verify the tools appear.

1. Go to **Chatbot Settings** → check **Enable Write Operations** → Save.
2. Send: `Search for customers matching "Acme"`
3. **Expected**: The AI uses the `search_customers` tool and returns matching customer records. The blue "Used ERPNext Tools" indicator should show "Customers" (with `search_` prefix stripped).
4. Send: `Find items in the "Raw Material" item group`
5. **Expected**: The AI uses `search_items` and returns matching items.
6. Send: `Search for open Sales Orders`
7. **Expected**: The AI uses `search_documents` with doctype="Sales Order" and status="Open" (or similar). Returns matching documents.

### 3.5 Create Tools (Write Operations)

1. Ensure **Enable Write Operations** is checked in Chatbot Settings.
2. Send: `Create a lead named John Smith from Acme Corp with email john@acme.com`
3. **Expected**:
   - The AI should **NOT** immediately create the lead.
   - Instead, it should present the details in a formatted summary and ask: "Shall I proceed?" (or similar confirmation).
   - This is enforced by the system prompt and tool description.
4. Reply: `Yes, proceed`
5. **Expected**:
   - The AI calls the `create_lead` tool.
   - A new Lead document is created in ERPNext.
   - The response confirms creation with the Lead document name (e.g., "Lead CRM-LEAD-00042 created successfully").
   - The amber **"Document Operations Performed"** indicator appears below the response with "Create Lead" tag.
6. **Verify in ERPNext**: Go to `/app/lead` and confirm the new lead exists with the correct details.

### 3.6 Create Opportunity

1. Send: `Create an opportunity for customer "John Smith" worth 50000 INR at Prospecting stage`
2. **Expected**: AI presents details and asks for confirmation.
3. Confirm with: `Yes`
4. **Expected**: Opportunity created. Amber indicator shows "Create Opportunity".
5. **Verify**: Check `/app/opportunity` for the new record.

### 3.7 Create ToDo

1. Send: `Create a task to follow up with John Smith by next Friday`
2. **Expected**: AI presents the ToDo details (description, date, priority) and asks for confirmation.
3. Confirm.
4. **Expected**: ToDo created. Amber indicator shows "Create Todo".
5. **Verify**: Check `/app/todo` for the new task.

### 3.8 Update Tools (Write Operations)

1. First, find a Lead name: Send `Search for leads matching "John Smith"`
2. Note the Lead name from the response (e.g., `CRM-LEAD-00042`).
3. Send: `Update lead CRM-LEAD-00042 status to Interested`
4. **Expected**: AI confirms the change and asks for approval.
5. Confirm.
6. **Expected**: Lead status updated. Amber indicator shows "Update Lead Status".
7. **Verify**: Check the Lead document in ERPNext — status should be "Interested".

### 3.9 Update ToDo

1. Send: `Mark my latest todo as closed`
2. **Expected**: AI may first search for your ToDos, then ask to confirm which one to close.
3. After confirmation, the ToDo status should be updated.
4. **Verify**: Check `/app/todo`.

### 3.10 Write Operations Disabled

1. Go to **Chatbot Settings** → **uncheck** "Enable Write Operations" → Save.
2. Refresh the chatbot page.
3. Send: `Create a lead named Jane Doe`
4. **Expected**: The AI should **not** have access to create/update/search tools. It should respond that it cannot create records or suggest going to the Lead form manually.
5. Re-enable Write Operations after testing.

### 3.11 Permission Check

1. Log in as a user with **limited permissions** (not System Manager).
2. Open the chatbot.
3. Try: `Create a lead named Test User`
4. **Expected**: If the user doesn't have create permission on Lead, the tool should return a permission error, and the AI should relay this to the user.

### 3.12 Tool Call Indicators — Read vs Write

1. Send a question that triggers both read and write tools in the same conversation (across different messages):
   - First: `What are the total sales this month?` → should show **blue** "Used ERPNext Tools" indicator.
   - Then: `Create a todo to review sales report` → after confirmation, should show **amber** "Document Operations Performed" indicator.
2. **Expected**: Blue indicator for read-only tools (get_*, search_*), amber indicator for write tools (create_*, update_*).

### 3.13 Error Handling — Invalid Status

1. Send: `Update lead CRM-LEAD-00042 status to "InvalidStatus"`
2. **Expected**: The AI (or the tool) should return an error indicating the status is invalid and list valid options.

### 3.14 Error Handling — Non-Existent Document

1. Send: `Update lead NONEXISTENT-LEAD-999 status to Open`
2. **Expected**: The tool should return an error that the document doesn't exist.

   print(result)  # Should be {"success": False, "error": "You do not have permission to access Sales Invoice"}
   ```
2. **Expected**: Returns a permission error, not sales data.

#### 5B.1.5 Permission Error Message in Chat

1. If a restricted user somehow triggers a tool they lack permission for, the AI should relay the error clearly.
2. **Expected**: The AI says something like "You don't have permission to access this data" — no unhandled exceptions.

---

### 5B.2 Accounting Dimension Tests

#### 5B.2.1 AR Aging Filtered by Cost Center

1. Ask: `Show me receivable aging for cost center "Main - TC"`
2. **Expected**: The AI calls `get_receivable_aging` with `cost_center="Main - TC"`. Results are filtered to only invoices matching that cost center.
3. Verify in bench console:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.tools.finance.receivables import get_receivable_aging
   result = get_receivable_aging(cost_center="Main - TC")
   print(result)  # Should show filtered results
   ```

#### 5B.2.2 Profitability Filtered by Department

1. Ask: `Show me profitability by customer for the Sales department`
2. **Expected**: The AI calls `get_profitability_by_customer` with `department="Sales"`. Only invoices tagged to the Sales department are included.

#### 5B.2.3 Budget vs Actual Filtered by Project

1. Ask: `What's the budget variance for Project Alpha?`
2. **Expected**: The AI calls `get_budget_vs_actual` with `project="Project Alpha"`. Results show budget performance for that project only.

#### 5B.2.4 Cash Flow Filtered by Cost Center

1. Ask: `Show me cash flow for cost center "Main - TC"`
2. **Expected**: The AI calls `get_cash_flow_statement` with `cost_center="Main - TC"`. Payment entries are filtered by cost center.

#### 5B.2.5 No Dimension Filter — Returns All Data

1. Ask: `Show me receivable aging`  (no dimension mentioned)
2. **Expected**: The AI calls `get_receivable_aging` without dimension parameters. All data is returned — dimension params are optional and default to None.

#### 5B.2.6 System Prompt Mentions Dimensions

1. Check that the system prompt includes dimension filtering context:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.core.prompts import build_system_prompt
   prompt = build_system_prompt()
   print("cost_center" in prompt or "dimension" in prompt.lower())  # Should be True
   ```

---

### 5B.4 CFO Reporting Tests

#### 5B.4.1 Financial Overview

1. Ask: `Give me a financial overview` or `Show me the key financial metrics`
2. **Expected**: The AI calls `get_financial_overview` and returns:
   - Revenue, COGS, gross profit, net profit
   - Cash position (bank balance)
   - Total AR and AP outstanding
   - A bar chart showing these KPIs
3. Verify in bench console:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.tools.finance.cfo import get_financial_overview
   result = get_financial_overview()
   print(list(result.keys()))  # Should include: revenue, cogs, gross_profit, net_profit, cash_position, ar_outstanding, ap_outstanding, echart_option
   ```

#### 5B.4.2 CFO Dashboard — Comprehensive Report

1. Ask: `Show me the CFO dashboard` or `Give me a full financial dashboard`
2. **Expected**: The AI calls `get_cfo_dashboard` and returns a structured report with sections:
   - Financial highlights (revenue, profit, cash)
   - KPIs — financial (gross margin %, net margin %), operational (DSO, DPO, DIO, CCC), liquidity (current ratio, quick ratio)
   - Cash flow summary (operating, investing, financing)
   - Receivables and payables aging summaries
   - Budget variance summary
3. Verify in bench console:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.tools.finance.cfo import get_cfo_dashboard
   result = get_cfo_dashboard()
   print(list(result.keys()))  # Should include: financial_highlights, kpis, cash_flow, receivables_summary, payables_summary, budget_summary
   ```

#### 5B.4.3 Monthly Comparison — MoM Variance

1. Ask: `Show me month-over-month comparison for the last 3 months`
2. **Expected**: The AI calls `get_monthly_comparison(months=3)` and returns:
   - Monthly revenue, expenses, net profit for each of the last 3 months
   - Month-over-month variance (amount and %)
   - A multi-series line chart
3. Verify in bench console:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.tools.finance.cfo import get_monthly_comparison
   result = get_monthly_comparison(months=3)
   print(f"Months: {len(result.get('months', []))}")  # Should be 3
   print("echart_option" in result)  # Should be True
   ```

#### 5B.4.4 CFO Dashboard with No Data

1. Use a company with no transactions.
2. Ask for the CFO dashboard.
3. **Expected**: Returns zeros/empty values gracefully — no crashes or unhandled exceptions.

---

### 5B.5 Multi-Company / Consolidation Tests

#### 5B.5.1 Parent Company Detection in System Prompt

1. Set up a company hierarchy (parent company with subsidiaries) in ERPNext.
2. Log in as a user whose default company is the parent company.
3. Verify the system prompt includes consolidation context:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.core.prompts import build_system_prompt
   prompt = build_system_prompt()
   print("subsidiaries" in prompt.lower() or "parent company" in prompt.lower())  # Should be True
   ```

#### 5B.5.2 Non-Parent Company — No Consolidation Context

1. Set the user's default company to a company with no subsidiaries.
2. Verify the system prompt does NOT include consolidation/subsidiary mentions:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.core.prompts import build_system_prompt
   prompt = build_system_prompt()
   print("subsidiaries" in prompt.lower())  # Should be False
   ```

#### 5B.5.3 Consolidation Functions in Bench Console

1. Verify helper functions work:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.core.consolidation import is_parent_company, get_child_companies
   print(is_parent_company("Your Parent Company"))  # True if it has children
   print(get_child_companies("Your Parent Company"))  # List of subsidiary company names
   ```

---

### 5B.6 Configurable Prompts Tests

#### 5B.6.1 Custom Persona

1. Go to Chatbot Settings → Prompt Configuration.
2. Set **AI Persona** to: `a friendly CFO assistant named FinBot`
3. Open the chatbot and ask: `Who are you?`
4. **Expected**: The AI identifies itself as "FinBot" or references the custom persona.

#### 5B.6.2 Response Language

1. Set **Response Language** to "Hindi" (or any non-English language).
2. Ask a question in the chatbot.
3. **Expected**: The AI responds in the configured language.
4. Set back to blank (default English) and verify normal behavior.

#### 5B.6.3 Custom System Prompt

1. Set **Custom System Prompt** to: `Always end your responses with "— FinBot"`
2. Ask a question.
3. **Expected**: The AI follows the custom instruction and appends "— FinBot" to responses.

#### 5B.6.4 Default Behavior — All Blank

1. Leave all prompt configuration fields blank.
2. **Expected**: The AI uses the default persona ("an intelligent ERPNext business assistant") and responds in English. Standard behavior unchanged.

---

### 5B.7 Configurable Constants Tests

#### 5B.7.1 Change Default Query Limit

1. Go to Chatbot Settings → Query Configuration.
2. Set **Default Query Limit** to 5.
3. Ask: `Show me stock movement` (which uses the default query limit).
4. **Expected**: The result returns at most 5 items.
5. Verify in bench console:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.core.config import get_query_limit
   print(get_query_limit())  # Should be 5
   ```

#### 5B.7.2 Max Query Limit Caps Requests

1. Set **Max Query Limit** to 25.
2. Ask for top 50 customers.
3. **Expected**: The result is capped at 25, even though 50 was requested.
4. Verify in bench console:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.core.config import get_query_limit
   print(get_query_limit(50))  # Should be 25 (capped at max)
   ```

#### 5B.7.3 Default Values When Fields Are Empty

1. Clear all query configuration fields (set to 0 or blank).
2. Verify the system uses fallback defaults from constants:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.core.config import get_query_limit, get_top_n_limit
   print(get_query_limit())    # Should be 20 (DEFAULT_QUERY_LIMIT)
   print(get_top_n_limit())    # Should be 10 (DEFAULT_TOP_N_LIMIT)
   ```

---

### 5B.8 Plugin System Tests

#### 5B.8.1 Verify Hooks Configuration

1. Check that `hooks.py` declares the tool module hook:
   ```python
   import ai_chatbot.hooks as hooks
   print(hasattr(hooks, "ai_chatbot_tool_modules"))  # Should be True
   ```

#### 5B.8.2 External App Can Register Tools via Hooks

1. In another Frappe app's `hooks.py`, add:
   ```python
   ai_chatbot_tool_modules = ["my_app.chatbot_tools"]
   ```
2. Create `my_app/chatbot_tools.py` with a `@register_tool(...)` decorated function.
3. Restart bench and verify the tool appears in the registry:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.tools.registry import get_registered_tools
   print(get_registered_tools())  # Should include the new tool
   ```

#### 5B.8.3 Failed Plugin Import — Logged, Doesn't Crash

1. Add a non-existent module path to the hook: `ai_chatbot_tool_modules = ["nonexistent.module"]`
2. Restart bench. The chatbot should still work.
3. Check Error Log (`/app/error-log`) for: `Failed to load AI Chatbot tool plugin: nonexistent.module`
4. **Expected**: Other tools still load and function normally.

#### 5B.8.4 Dynamic Category Registration

1. In bench console, register a custom category:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.tools.registry import register_tool_category
   register_tool_category("manufacturing", settings_field=None)
   ```
2. **Expected**: Tools registered with `category="manufacturing"` will now be included in the schema (always enabled since `settings_field=None`).

---

## Pre-Phase 6A: Favicon, Logo & User Avatar

### Pre-6A.0 Prerequisites

```bash
# Rebuild frontend (updated ChatMessage, ChatView with avatar/logo)
cd apps/ai_chatbot/frontend && npm run build

# Restart bench to pick up Python changes (updated get_settings endpoint)
bench start
```

---

### Pre-6A.1 Favicon

#### Pre-6A.1.1 Favicon Visible in Browser Tab

1. Open the chatbot: `http://<SITE>:8005/ai-chatbot`
2. **Expected**: The browser tab shows the AI Chatbot favicon (purple/teal chat bubble icon) instead of the default Frappe/browser icon.
3. Check the page source: the `<head>` should contain:
   ```html
   <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/assets/ai_chatbot/frontend/favicon.svg">
   ```

---

### Pre-6A.2 AI Message Avatar (Logo)

#### Pre-6A.2.1 AI Messages Show Logo

1. Open the chatbot and send a message (e.g., `Hello`).
2. Wait for the AI response.
3. **Expected**: The AI message displays the app logo SVG (purple gradient circle with chat bubble + neural network icon) as a 32×32 rounded avatar — replacing the old "AI" text badge.

#### Pre-6A.2.2 Streaming Message Shows Logo

1. Ensure streaming is enabled in Chatbot Settings.
2. Send a message that produces a longer response (e.g., `Explain the key features of ERPNext`).
3. **Expected**: While the response is streaming, the streaming message also shows the app logo avatar (not "AI" text).

#### Pre-6A.2.3 Logo Consistent Across Messages

1. Send several messages in a conversation.
2. Scroll through the message history.
3. **Expected**: Every AI message (both streamed and loaded from history) displays the same logo avatar.

---

### Pre-6A.3 User Avatar

#### Pre-6A.3.1 User Avatar from Profile Image

1. Ensure the current user has a profile image set:
   - Go to **User Settings** (`/app/user/<your-email>`) → **Profile** → set an image.
2. Open the chatbot and send a message.
3. **Expected**: The user message bubble displays the user's profile image as a 32×32 rounded avatar.

#### Pre-6A.3.2 User Initials Fallback (No Avatar)

1. Log in as a user who does **not** have a profile image set (or remove the current user's image).
2. Open the chatbot and send a message.
3. **Expected**: The user message bubble displays the user's initials (e.g., "SK" for "Sanjay Kumar", "A" for "Administrator") in a rounded badge with semi-transparent white background.

#### Pre-6A.3.3 User Info from API

1. Open browser DevTools → Network tab.
2. Load/refresh the chatbot page.
3. Find the `get_settings` API call.
4. **Expected**: The response JSON includes a `user` object:
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "settings": { ... },
     "user": {
       "fullname": "Sanjay Kumar",
       "avatar": "/files/user-avatar.png"
     }
   }
   ```
   - `avatar` will be `null` if no profile image is set.
   - `fullname` should match the logged-in user's full name.

#### Pre-6A.3.4 Avatar Across All Messages

1. Send multiple messages in a conversation.
2. Scroll through the conversation.
3. **Expected**: Every user message (both newly sent and loaded from history) displays the same avatar (image or initials).

## Phase 6: Settings Overhaul, Gemini Provider & Token Optimization

### 6.0 Prerequisites

```bash
# Migrate database (new fields + Token Usage DocType)
bench --site <SITE> migrate

# Rebuild frontend
cd apps/ai_chatbot/frontend && npm run build

# Restart bench
bench start
```

---

### 6.1 Chatbot Settings Overhaul

#### 6.1.1 Tabbed Interface

1. Go to **Chatbot Settings** (`/app/chatbot-settings`).
2. **Expected**: The settings page shows 5 tabs:
   - **API Configuration** — AI Provider dropdown, API Key, Model, Temperature, Max Tokens, Max Context Messages
   - **Tools** — CRM, Sales, Purchase, Finance, Inventory, HRMS checkboxes + Write Operations
   - **Query Configuration** — Default Query Limit, Default Top-N Limit, Max Query Limit
   - **Prompts** — AI Persona, Response Language, Custom System Prompt, Custom Instructions
   - **Streaming** — Enable Streaming checkbox

#### 6.1.2 Unified Provider Dropdown

1. In the **API Configuration** tab, set **AI Provider** to "OpenAI".
2. Enter a valid OpenAI API key in the **API Key** field.
3. Leave **Model** blank (should default to `gpt-4o`).
4. Save the settings.
5. **Expected**: Settings save without error. The API Key field is a Password field (encrypted).

#### 6.1.3 Switch Provider to Claude

1. Change **AI Provider** to "Claude".
2. Enter a valid Claude API key.
3. Set **Model** to `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`.
4. Save.
5. Open the chatbot and send a message.
6. **Expected**: Response comes from Claude (check response style or model mentions).

#### 6.1.4 Legacy Compatibility

1. If you have existing settings with `openai_enabled=1` and `openai_api_key` set (legacy fields):
   - Clear the new **API Key** field.
   - **Expected**: The system falls back to legacy `openai_api_key` for OpenAI provider.
2. This is backward-compatible — existing deployments continue to work without re-configuration.

---

### 6.2 Gemini Provider

#### 6.2.1 Gemini Configuration

1. In **Chatbot Settings**, set **AI Provider** to "Gemini".
2. Enter a valid Google AI Studio API key.
3. Leave **Model** blank (defaults to `gemini-2.5-flash`).
4. Save.

#### 6.2.2 Gemini Chat Response

1. Open the chatbot and send: `Hello, what model are you?`
2. **Expected**: Response from Gemini model. The header dropdown should show "Gemini".

#### 6.2.3 Gemini with Tools

1. Send: `What are my top 5 customers by sales?`
2. **Expected**: Gemini calls the appropriate tool and returns results (same as OpenAI — uses OpenAI-compatible endpoint).

#### 6.2.4 Gemini Streaming

1. Ensure **Enable Streaming** is checked.
2. Send a message that generates a longer response.
3. **Expected**: Tokens stream in real-time (same as OpenAI streaming).

#### 6.2.5 Provider Selector in Header

1. Open the chatbot.
2. Click the provider dropdown in the header.
3. **Expected**: Three options visible — OpenAI, Claude, Gemini.
4. Select Gemini from the dropdown.
5. Start a new conversation.
6. **Expected**: New conversation uses Gemini as the provider.

---

### 6.3 Financial Analysis Behaviour

#### 6.3.1 Finance Prompt Active

1. Ensure **Enable Finance Tools** is checked in settings.
2. Send: `What is our accounts receivable aging?`
3. **Expected**: The response includes:
   - Professional financial terminology (DSO, aging buckets)
   - Comparison context (if available)
   - Risk highlights for overdue amounts
   - Suggested next steps

#### 6.3.2 Finance Prompt Inactive

1. Uncheck **Enable Finance Tools** in settings.
2. Send a finance question.
3. **Expected**: The AI responds generically (no CFO-style analysis) because finance tools and behaviour are disabled.

---

### 6.4 Token Optimization

#### 6.4.1 History Trimming

1. In **Chatbot Settings**, set **Max Context Messages** to `5`.
2. Send 10+ messages in a single conversation.
3. Open browser DevTools → Network → check the `send_message` request payload.
4. **Expected**: The conversation remains functional even with the context limit. Earlier messages are trimmed but the AI still responds coherently.

#### 6.4.2 Unlimited Context

1. Set **Max Context Messages** to `0` (unlimited).
2. Send several messages.
3. **Expected**: All messages are included in context (no trimming).

#### 6.4.3 Tool Result Compression

1. Send a query that returns a large dataset (e.g., `List all sales invoices this year`).
2. Follow up with another question.
3. **Expected**: The follow-up works correctly — tool results in history are compressed (echart_option removed, data truncated) to save tokens.

---

### 6.5 Cost Monitoring

#### 6.5.1 Token Usage Recorded

1. Send a message via the chatbot (non-streaming).
2. Go to **Chatbot Token Usage** list view (`/app/chatbot-token-usage`).
3. **Expected**: A new record exists with:
   - User = your user
   - Provider = the selected provider
   - Model = the model used
   - Prompt Tokens, Completion Tokens, Total Tokens filled
   - Estimated Cost > 0 (for known models)
   - Date = today

#### 6.5.2 Streaming Token Tracking

1. Send a message with streaming enabled.
2. Check the Token Usage list.
3. **Expected**: A new record for the streaming request (note: streaming uses estimated tokens).

#### 6.5.3 Cost Estimation

1. Check the **Estimated Cost** column for different providers.
2. **Expected**: OpenAI GPT-4o costs differ from Claude Sonnet, which differ from Gemini Flash (Gemini should be cheapest).

### 6.6 Source File Header Policy

#### 6.6.1 Python File Headers

1. Open any Python file in the project (e.g., `ai_chatbot/api/chat.py`, `ai_chatbot/core/token_tracker.py`, `ai_chatbot/tools/crm.py`).
2. **Expected**: The file starts with:
   ```python
   # Copyright (c) 2026, Sanjay Kumar and contributors
   # For license information, please see license.txt
   ```
3. Check DocType-generated files (e.g., `ai_chatbot/chatbot/doctype/chatbot_settings/chatbot_settings.py`).
4. **Expected**: Same header with "Sanjay Kumar" (not "Your Company") and year 2026.

#### 6.6.2 JavaScript File Headers

1. Open any JavaScript file (e.g., `frontend/src/utils/api.js`, `frontend/src/utils/markdown.js`).
2. **Expected**: The file starts with:
   ```javascript
   // Copyright (c) 2026, Sanjay Kumar and contributors
   // For license information, please see license.txt
   ```

#### 6.6.3 Vue File Headers

1. Open any Vue single-file component (e.g., `frontend/src/pages/ChatView.vue`, `frontend/src/components/ChatMessage.vue`).
2. **Expected**: The file starts with:
   ```html
   <!-- Copyright (c) 2026, Sanjay Kumar and contributors -->
   <!-- For license information, please see license.txt -->
   ```

#### 6.6.4 Spot-Check Coverage

1. Run a quick spot-check across the project:
   ```bash
   # Count Python files missing the header
   grep -rL "Copyright (c) 2026, Sanjay Kumar" --include="*.py" ai_chatbot/ | grep -v __pycache__ | grep -v ".pyc"

   # Count JS files missing the header
   grep -rL "Copyright (c) 2026, Sanjay Kumar" --include="*.js" frontend/src/

   # Count Vue files missing the header
   grep -rL "Copyright (c) 2026, Sanjay Kumar" --include="*.vue" frontend/src/
   ```
2. **Expected**: No files returned (all source files have the header).
3. **Note**: Empty `__init__.py` files may legitimately be header-only (just the 2-line copyright).

---

## Troubleshooting

### File upload not working

1. Check browser console for errors during upload (look for failed `POST` to `/api/method/ai_chatbot.api.files.upload_chat_file`).
2. Verify the file size is under 10MB.
3. Verify the MIME type is in the allowed list (images, PDF, CSV, XLSX, DOCX, TXT).
4. Check Error Log (`/app/error-log`) for server-side upload errors.
5. Verify the conversation exists and belongs to the current user (ownership check).

### Microphone button not appearing

1. This is expected in Firefox — Web Speech API (`SpeechRecognition`) is not supported.
2. In Chrome/Edge/Safari, ensure the page is served over HTTPS or localhost. SpeechRecognition requires a secure context.
3. Check browser console for `SpeechRecognition is not defined` errors.

### Voice output not speaking

1. Verify browser supports `SpeechSynthesis`: open DevTools console and type `window.speechSynthesis` — should not be `undefined`.
2. Some browsers require a user interaction before first speech — click the "Listen" button (not triggered programmatically from page load).
3. Check if the system has voice packs installed (some Linux distros need `espeak` or similar).

### Sidebar toggle state not persisting

1. Check `localStorage` in DevTools: Application → Local Storage → look for key `ai_chatbot_sidebar`.
2. Value should be `collapsed` or `expanded`.
3. If localStorage is blocked (privacy mode), the state won't persist.

### @mention dropdown not showing

1. Ensure you type `@` at the start of input or after a space. Typing `@` in the middle of a word (e.g., `email@`) will not trigger the dropdown.
2. Check browser console for errors from the `get_mention_values` API call.
3. Verify the backend endpoint works: test in bench console:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.api.chat import get_mention_values
   print(get_mention_values("company"))
   print(get_mention_values("period"))
   ```

### Streaming not working (message appears all at once)

1. **Check Socket.IO connection**: Open DevTools Console and look for:
   - `[AI Chatbot] Socket.IO connecting to: http://test.local:9005 (namespace: /test.local)` (dev mode) or `http://test.local (namespace: /test.local)` (nginx).
   - `[AI Chatbot] Socket.IO connected` — confirms connection is established.
2. **Check `common_site_config.json`**: Ensure `socketio_port` is set (default: `9000`, your bench uses `9005`).
3. **Check background workers**: The streaming job runs as a background job via `frappe.enqueue`. Ensure `bench start` is running (it starts workers automatically).
4. **Check Redis**: Socket.IO relies on Redis Pub/Sub. Ensure Redis is running: `redis-cli -p 13005 ping` should return `PONG`.
5. **Check background jobs**: Go to `/app/background-jobs` in Frappe desk and verify the streaming job is being processed (not stuck in queue).

### Socket.IO connection error (`xhr poll error`)

1. **Check the URL in console**: Look for `[AI Chatbot] Socket.IO connecting to:` — verify the URL looks correct:
   - **With nginx**: `http://test.local` (same origin, nginx proxies `/socket.io` to the socketio process)
   - **Without nginx**: `http://test.local:9005` (direct connection to socketio port)
2. **Access via the site name**: Make sure you access the chatbot via the Frappe site name (e.g., `http://test.local/ai-chatbot` or `http://test.local:8005/ai-chatbot`), NOT via `localhost`. The Socket.IO auth middleware checks that the request origin matches the host.
3. **With nginx — check CORS**: If you see "Cross-Origin Request Blocked", ensure your nginx config has the `location /socket.io` proxy block. The Socket.IO client connects to the same origin as the page, so nginx must proxy `/socket.io` requests to the socketio process.
4. **Verify socketio process**: Check `bench start` output for the socketio line like `Realtime service listening on: ws://0.0.0.0:9005`.
5. **Check if port is accessible**: `curl http://test.local:9005/socket.io/?EIO=4&transport=polling` — should return a JSON response (Socket.IO handshake), not a connection error.
6. **Check `/etc/hosts`**: Ensure your site name resolves: `ping test.local` should return `127.0.0.1`.

### Cross-Origin Request Blocked (with nginx)

If you're using nginx and see CORS errors for `/socket.io`:
1. Ensure your nginx site config has a `location /socket.io` block that proxies to the socketio process.
2. Example nginx config for Socket.IO:
   ```nginx
   location /socket.io {
       proxy_http_version 1.1;
       proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
       proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
       proxy_set_header X-Frappe-Site-Name $host;
       proxy_set_header Origin $scheme://$http_host;
       proxy_set_header Host $host;
       proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9005;
   }
   ```
3. After updating nginx config: `sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx`

### Typing indicator not showing

1. The typing indicator shows when `isLoading` is `true` and no streaming content has arrived yet.
2. If it never appears, check if the `send_message` HTTP request is failing (check Network tab for errors).

### "AI is thinking..." shows but no response

1. Check the Error Log in Frappe (`/app/error-log`) for streaming errors.
2. Check the background job queue: `/app/background-jobs` — look for failed jobs.
3. Verify the AI provider API key is valid and the provider is reachable.
4. Check if workers are running: `bench doctor` shows worker status.

### AI doesn't know company/fiscal year (Phase 3)

1. The system prompt injects user context (company, currency, fiscal year) dynamically.
2. If the AI says it doesn't know your company, check:
   - Is a **default company** set for the user? Go to **User Settings** → **Defaults** → **Company**.
   - Or set a global default: `bench --site test.local set-config default_company "Your Company Name"`.
3. If fiscal year is wrong, check **Fiscal Year** DocType in ERPNext — ensure a fiscal year exists that covers today's date and is linked to your company.

### Create/Update tools not appearing (Phase 3)

1. Ensure **Enable Write Operations** is checked in Chatbot Settings.
2. After changing settings, **refresh** the chatbot page (the tool schema is fetched on page load).
3. Check the Error Log (`/app/error-log`) — if a tool module fails to import, the registry may be incomplete.
4. Verify in bench console:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.tools.registry import get_registered_tools
   print(get_registered_tools())
   # Should include: create_lead, create_opportunity, create_todo,
   #                  update_lead_status, update_opportunity_status, update_todo,
   #                  search_customers, search_items, search_documents
   ```

### AI creates records without asking for confirmation (Phase 3)

1. The confirmation pattern is prompt-driven — the system prompt instructs the AI to confirm before writes.
2. If the AI skips confirmation, this is an LLM behavioral issue, not a code bug.
3. The tool descriptions also include "IMPORTANT: Always confirm details with the user before calling this tool."
4. Try switching to a more instruction-following model (e.g., GPT-4o instead of GPT-3.5-Turbo).

### Permission error when creating/updating records (Phase 3)

1. The operations layer checks `frappe.has_permission()` before every write.
2. If you get "You do not have permission", ensure the logged-in user has the appropriate role (e.g., "Sales User" for Leads, "System Manager" for full access).
3. Check role permissions: **Setup** → **Role Permission Manager** → search for the DocType.

### Amber indicator not showing for write operations (Phase 3)

1. The amber "Document Operations Performed" indicator appears when tool calls have names starting with `create_` or `update_`.
2. If you see write tool calls in the blue indicator instead, hard-refresh the page (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) to clear cached frontend assets.
3. Ensure the frontend was rebuilt: `cd apps/ai_chatbot/frontend && npm run build`.

### Charts not rendering (Phase 4)

1. Ensure echarts is installed: `cd apps/ai_chatbot/frontend && npm ls echarts` — should show `echarts@6.x.x`.
2. Rebuild frontend after installing: `npm run build`.
3. Hard-refresh the browser (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) to clear cached bundles.
4. Check browser console for errors — look for "echarts is not defined" or chunk loading failures.
5. Verify the tool response includes `echart_option` — check Error Log or bench console:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.tools.finance.receivables import get_receivable_aging
   result = get_receivable_aging()
   print("echart_option" in result.get("data", {}))  # Should be True
   ```

### Finance tools not appearing (Phase 4)

1. Ensure **Enable Finance Tools** is checked in Chatbot Settings.
2. Refresh the chatbot page after changing settings.
3. Verify tools are registered:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.tools.registry import get_registered_tools
   tools = get_registered_tools()
   finance_tools = [t for t in tools if t.get("category") == "finance"]
   print(f"Finance tools: {len(finance_tools)}")  # Should be 17
   ```
4. Check Error Log (`/app/error-log`) for import errors in finance modules.

### Finance tools return empty results (Phase 4)

1. Finance tools query **posted** (submitted) documents. Draft invoices are excluded.
2. Verify you have submitted Sales Invoices: `/app/sales-invoice?docstatus=1`.
3. Verify you have submitted Purchase Invoices: `/app/purchase-invoice?docstatus=1`.
4. Budget tools require Budget records: `/app/budget`.
5. Working capital tools use GL Entry balances — ensure journal entries are posted.
6. Check that the fiscal year covers today's date: `/app/fiscal-year`.

### HRMS tools not appearing (Phase 5)

1. Ensure the **HRMS app** is installed: `bench --site test.local list-apps` — should include `hrms`.
2. If HRMS is not installed, HRMS tools will **not** be loaded into the registry (by design).
3. Ensure **Enable HRMS Tools** is checked in Chatbot Settings.
4. Refresh the chatbot page after changing settings.
5. Verify tools are registered:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.tools.registry import get_registered_tools
   tools = get_registered_tools()
   hrms_tools = [name for name, cat in tools.items() if cat == "hrms"]
   print(f"HRMS tools: {len(hrms_tools)}")  # Should be 6
   ```
6. Check Error Log (`/app/error-log`) for import errors in `ai_chatbot.tools.hrms`.

### HRMS tools return empty results (Phase 5)

1. HRMS tools query ERPNext/HRMS DocTypes. Ensure you have data:
   - **Employee records**: `/app/employee` — at least some Active employees.
   - **Attendance records**: `/app/attendance` — attendance marked for the period.
   - **Leave Allocations**: `/app/leave-allocation?docstatus=1` — submitted allocations for the current period.
   - **Salary Slips**: `/app/salary-slip?docstatus=1` — submitted salary slips.
2. Payroll tools only count **submitted** salary slips (docstatus=1). Draft slips are excluded.
3. Leave balance checks `total_leaves_allocated` from active allocations (current date within from_date/to_date).
4. Employee turnover counts `date_of_joining` (new hires) and `relieving_date` with status="Left" (exits).

### CRM tools not appearing (Phase 5)

1. Ensure **ERPNext** is installed: `bench --site test.local list-apps` — should include `erpnext`.
2. If ERPNext is not installed, CRM, selling, buying, finance, and inventory tools will **not** load.
3. Ensure **Enable CRM Tools** is checked in Chatbot Settings.
4. Verify:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.tools.registry import get_registered_tools
   tools = get_registered_tools()
   crm_tools = [name for name, cat in tools.items() if cat == "crm"]
   print(f"CRM tools: {len(crm_tools)}")  # Should be 6
   ```

### Tools hidden unexpectedly (Phase 5B — Permissions)

1. Phase 5B added doctype-based permission checks. If a tool suddenly disappears for a user, the user likely lacks **read** permission on one of the tool's declared doctypes.
2. Check which doctypes a tool requires:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.tools.registry import get_tool_info
   info = get_tool_info("get_sales_analytics")
   print(info["doctypes"])  # e.g., ["Sales Invoice"]
   ```
3. Check user permissions for those doctypes:
   ```python
   import frappe
   frappe.set_user("user@example.com")
   print(frappe.has_permission("Sales Invoice", "read"))  # True or False
   ```
4. Fix by granting the appropriate role (e.g., "Sales User" for Sales Invoice access).

### Dimension filters not working (Phase 5B)

1. Dimension filtering is optional — if no `cost_center`, `department`, or `project` is passed, all data is returned.
2. Verify the dimension value exists in ERPNext: `/app/cost-center`, `/app/department`, `/app/project`.
3. Verify the field exists on the doctype being queried. The `apply_dimension_filters` helper only applies filters for fields that exist on the table's meta.
4. Test in bench console:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.tools.finance.receivables import get_receivable_aging
   result = get_receivable_aging(cost_center="Main - TC")
   print(result)
   ```

### CFO dashboard returns zeros (Phase 5B)

1. The CFO dashboard aggregates data from multiple sources (Sales Invoice, Purchase Invoice, GL Entry, Payment Entry, Budget).
2. Ensure you have **submitted** transactions for the current fiscal year.
3. `cash_position` requires GL entries in bank/cash accounts. Check that bank accounts exist: `/app/account?account_type=Bank`.
4. Budget data requires Budget records linked to cost centers. Check: `/app/budget`.
5. KPIs like DSO, DPO, DIO require both revenue and outstanding receivables/payables.

### Query limits not applying (Phase 5B)

1. After changing query limits in Chatbot Settings, **restart bench** — the settings object is cached.
2. Verify the settings values:
   ```python
   import frappe
   settings = frappe.get_single("Chatbot Settings")
   print(settings.default_query_limit, settings.default_top_n_limit, settings.max_query_limit)
   ```
3. If all values are 0 or blank, the system uses fallback defaults from `core/constants.py` (20, 10, 100).

### Custom prompt not taking effect (Phase 5B)

1. After changing prompt settings (persona, language, custom instructions), open a **new conversation**. The system prompt is set at the start of each conversation.
2. Verify in bench console:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.core.prompts import build_system_prompt
   prompt = build_system_prompt()
   print(prompt[:500])  # Check the beginning for custom persona
   ```
3. If blank, check Chatbot Settings → Prompt Configuration fields.

### Plugin tools not loading (Phase 5B)

1. External app tools are loaded via the `ai_chatbot_tool_modules` Frappe hook.
2. Check your external app's `hooks.py` has:
   ```python
   ai_chatbot_tool_modules = ["your_app.your_module"]
   ```
3. Check Error Log (`/app/error-log`) for: `Failed to load AI Chatbot tool plugin`.
4. Ensure the module path is correct and the module uses `@register_tool(...)` decorator.
5. After adding hooks, restart bench: `bench restart`.

## Phase 6A: UI Overhaul

### 6A.1 Sidebar Redesign

#### 6A.1.1 Expanded Sidebar

1. Open `/ai-chatbot`.
2. **Expected**: Sidebar is visible on the left (w-72) with: hamburger toggle icon + logo + settings gear in the header row, grey "New Chat" button, search input, date-grouped conversation list (Today, Yesterday, Last 7 Days, Older), provider selector dropdown at the bottom.
3. Click the **settings gear icon** → should navigate to Chatbot Settings.
4. Click the **provider dropdown** at the bottom → should show available providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini). Selecting one should change the provider.

#### 6A.1.2 Collapsed Sidebar

1. Click the **hamburger icon** (PanelLeftClose) in the sidebar header.
2. **Expected**: Sidebar collapses to a narrow icon strip (w-14) showing: expand button, new chat (+), search icon.
3. Click expand button → sidebar returns to full width.
4. Refresh the page → sidebar state should persist (stored in localStorage).

#### 6A.1.3 Date Grouping

1. Create conversations on different days (or have existing ones).
2. **Expected**: Conversations are grouped under "Today", "Yesterday", "Last 7 Days", "Older" headers based on their `updated_at` timestamp.
3. Empty groups should not be shown.

#### 6A.1.4 Header Removed

1. Verify there is **no header bar** above the chat area.
2. All header functionality (provider selector, settings, sidebar toggle) is now in the sidebar.

---

### 6A.2 ChatInput Cleanup

#### 6A.2.1 Icon-Only Buttons

1. Look at the chat input area.
2. **Expected**: Send button shows only a blue arrow icon (no "Send" text), Stop button shows only a red square icon (no "Stop" text).
3. Both buttons are 52×52px squares with rounded corners.

#### 6A.2.2 Suggestions Removed

1. Start a new conversation.
2. **Expected**: No suggestion chips appear. Instead, a personalized greeting is shown in the center of the chat area.

---

### 6A.3 Personalized Greeting

#### 6A.3.1 New Chat Greeting

1. Click "New Chat" in the sidebar.
2. **Expected**: The chat area shows a centered greeting: the orbital logo SVG, "Hello, {YourFullName}!", and "How can I help you today?" with the ChatInput centered below.

#### 6A.3.2 Input Moves to Bottom

1. Type a message and send it.
2. **Expected**: The greeting disappears, messages appear in the scrollable area, and the ChatInput moves to its bottom-pinned position.

---

### 6A.4 Chat Search

#### 6A.4.1 Search by Title

1. In the expanded sidebar, type a conversation title (or part of it) in the search input.
2. **Expected**: After a brief debounce, matching conversations appear, replacing the grouped list. A loading spinner shows during search.

#### 6A.4.2 Search by Message Content

1. Search for a word or phrase that exists in a message but NOT in the conversation title.
2. **Expected**: The conversation containing that message appears in results.

#### 6A.4.3 Clear Search

1. Clear the search input (backspace or click the X icon).
2. **Expected**: The search results disappear and the normal date-grouped conversation list returns.

#### 6A.4.4 No Results

1. Search for a nonsensical string (e.g., "xyzzy123").
2. **Expected**: "No results" empty state is shown.

---

### 6A.5 Wider AI Messages

1. Send a prompt that returns a table or long content (e.g., "Show me a summary of all sales invoices").
2. **Expected**: The AI response bubble is wider than before (`max-w-[85%]` on small screens, `max-w-5xl` on large screens). User messages remain narrower (`max-w-3xl`).
3. Tables and code blocks should use the full available width within the response bubble.

---

### 6A.6 Dark Mode

#### 6A.6.1 OS Dark Mode Detection

1. Set your OS to dark mode (System Settings → Appearance → Dark).
2. Open or refresh `/ai-chatbot`.
3. **Expected**: The entire UI switches to dark mode — dark backgrounds, light text, dark sidebar, dark input area, dark message bubbles for AI responses.

#### 6A.6.2 OS Light Mode

1. Set your OS to light mode.
2. Refresh the page.
3. **Expected**: The UI switches to light mode — white backgrounds, dark text.

#### 6A.6.3 Dynamic Theme Change

1. Open `/ai-chatbot` in a browser.
2. Without refreshing, change your OS theme from light to dark (or vice versa).
3. **Expected**: The UI updates automatically without a page refresh.

#### 6A.6.4 Dark Mode Markdown

1. In dark mode, send a prompt that returns markdown with code blocks, links, blockquotes, and tables.
2. **Expected**: All markdown elements are readable — code has dark background, links are blue, tables have visible borders, blockquotes have proper styling.

---

### 6A.7 Process Step Indicators

#### 6A.7.1 Basic Streaming

1. Send a simple message (e.g., "Hello").
2. **Expected**: While waiting for the response, the typing indicator shows the orbital logo with bouncing dots and text like "Preparing context...", then "Communicating with LLM...", then "Saving response..." before the final content appears.

#### 6A.7.2 Tool Call Steps

1. Send a query that triggers tool calls (e.g., "Show sales summary for this month").
2. **Expected**: Process steps show: "Preparing context..." → "Communicating with LLM..." → "Executing Get Sales Analytics..." (tool name) → "Processing results..." → "Saving response...".

#### 6A.7.3 Typing Indicator Design

1. Observe the typing indicator during streaming.
2. **Expected**: Shows the orbital logo SVG (not the old "AI" text circle) with three bouncing blue dots and the process step text.

---

### Troubleshooting Phase 6A

### Dark mode not working

1. Check that `tailwind.config.js` has `darkMode: 'class'`.
2. Check that the `<html>` element has the `dark` class when OS is in dark mode (inspect with DevTools).
3. If not, check `App.vue` — it should detect `prefers-color-scheme: dark` and toggle the class.

### Search not returning results

1. Verify the backend endpoint exists: `bench --site <SITE> console` → `frappe.get_attr('ai_chatbot.api.chat.search_conversations')`.
2. Check the search query is at least 2 characters.
3. Check Error Log for any search errors.

### Process steps not showing

1. Ensure streaming is enabled in Chatbot Settings.
2. Check browser console for `ai_chat_process_step` events (they should appear in the Socket.IO log).
3. Verify `useStreaming.js` exports `processStep` — check browser DevTools → Sources.

---

## Phase 6B: Multi-Dimensional Analytics & GL-Based Finance

### 6B.1 Multi-Dimensional Grouping

#### 6B.1.1 Single Dimension

1. Ask: `Show revenue by territory`
2. **Expected**: A stacked bar chart + hierarchical table showing territories with total and period columns (quarterly by default). Tool name `Multidimensional Summary` should appear in the "Used ERPNext Tools" badge.

#### 6B.1.2 Multiple Dimensions

1. Ask: `Show sales by territory and customer group, quarterly`
2. **Expected**: Hierarchical table with territory as group headers (bold, tinted background), customer groups as indented children. Each group header has subtotals. Stacked bar chart shows top-level territories.

#### 6B.1.3 Different Metrics

1. Ask: `Show expenses by department, monthly`
2. **Expected**: Purchase Invoice-based expenses grouped by department with monthly columns.
3. Ask: `Show profit by territory`
4. **Expected**: Computed profit (revenue - expenses) by territory.

#### 6B.1.4 Accounting Dimensions

1. If you have created Accounting Dimensions in ERPNext (e.g., "Business Vertical", "Business Segment"):
   - Ask: `Show sales by business_vertical` (use the exact fieldname)
   - **Expected**: The tool automatically discovers the accounting dimension and groups by it. If the dimension exists on Sales Invoice, data is returned.
2. If the dimension does NOT exist on the target doctype:
   - **Expected**: A clear error message: "Dimension 'xyz' does not exist on Sales Invoice. It may not be set up as an accounting dimension for this doctype."
3. If no accounting dimensions are set up, ask: `Show sales by some_random_field`
   - **Expected**: An error message listing the supported dimensions.

#### 6B.1.5 Item Group (Child Table JOIN)

1. Ask: `Show revenue by item group`
2. **Expected**: Revenue grouped by item group using Sales Invoice Item child table JOIN with `base_amount` aggregation.

---

### 6B.2 GL Entry Analytics

#### 6B.2.1 GL Summary

1. Ask: `Show GL summary by root type`
2. **Expected**: Aggregated debit/credit by root type (Asset, Liability, Equity, Income, Expense) with bar chart.
3. Ask: `Show GL summary by account type for expenses`
4. **Expected**: Filtered to Expense root type, grouped by account type.

#### 6B.2.2 Trial Balance

1. Ask: `Show trial balance for this fiscal year`
2. **Expected**: Accounts grouped by root type with opening balance, debit, credit, closing balance columns. Subtotals per root type. Grand total row at the bottom.

#### 6B.2.3 Account Statement

1. Ask: `Show account statement for [specific account name]`
2. **Expected**: Opening balance + individual GL entries with running balance column. Line chart showing balance trend over time.

---

### 6B.3 CFO Dashboard BI Cards

#### 6B.3.1 BI Cards Display

1. Ask: `Show CFO dashboard` or `Show financial overview`
2. **Expected**: A row of 5 metric cards appears above the chart: Revenue, Net Profit, Cash Position, AR Outstanding, AP Outstanding.
3. Revenue and Net Profit cards should show YoY change percentage with green (up) or red (down) trend indicator.
4. Values should be abbreviated (e.g., 1.2M, 450K).

#### 6B.3.2 BI Cards Responsiveness

1. Resize the browser window to different widths.
2. **Expected**: Cards reflow — 5 columns on large screens, 3 on medium, 2 on small.

---

### 6B.4 Sidebar Header

1. Open `/ai-chatbot` with sidebar expanded.
2. **Expected**: Sidebar header shows: App logo (left side), Settings gear button + Collapse toggle button (right side, grouped together).
3. **Before (6A)**: `[Toggle] [Logo] [Settings]` — centered logo.
4. **After (6B)**: `[Logo] ... [Settings] [Toggle]` — logo anchored left, actions right.

---

### 6B.5 Personalized Greeting Avatar

1. Click "New Chat" to see the greeting screen.
2. **Expected**: Shows your **user avatar** (profile picture) in a large circle (96×96px), NOT the app's orbital logo.
3. If you don't have a profile picture, it should show your initials in a gray circle.
4. Below the avatar: "Hello, {YourName}!" and "How can I help you today?"

---

### 6B.6 Hierarchical Table Rendering

1. Ask any multi-dimensional query (e.g., `Show revenue by territory and customer`)
2. **Expected hierarchical table features**:
   - Group rows (level 0) are **bold** with a slightly tinted background
   - Child rows are indented based on their level
   - Values are right-aligned with consistent decimal formatting
   - Table has horizontal scroll if many period columns
   - Table has proper dark mode styling (borders, text colors)

---

### Troubleshooting Phase 6B

#### BI cards not showing

1. Ensure the CFO dashboard tool returns `bi_cards` in the response. Check browser DevTools → Network → response payload.
2. Verify `ChatMessage.vue` imports `BiCards` component and has the `biCardsData` computed property.

#### Hierarchical table not rendering

1. Check that the tool result contains `hierarchical_table` with `headers` and `rows` arrays.
2. Verify `ChatMessage.vue` imports `HierarchicalTable` component.

#### Accounting dimension not recognized

1. Verify the accounting dimension exists: Go to **Accounting Dimension** list in ERPNext.
2. Ensure it is not disabled.
3. Check that the dimension's custom field was created on the target doctype (e.g., Sales Invoice).
4. Use the exact fieldname (not the label). Check fieldname in the Accounting Dimension document.
5. Run: `bench --site <SITE> console` → `from erpnext.accounts.doctype.accounting_dimension.accounting_dimension import get_accounting_dimensions; print(get_accounting_dimensions(as_list=False))`

#### GL tools not registered

1. Verify `tools/registry.py` imports both `ai_chatbot.tools.finance.analytics` and `ai_chatbot.tools.finance.gl_analytics`.
2. Run: `bench --site <SITE> console` → `from ai_chatbot.tools.registry import get_registered_tools; print([t for t in get_registered_tools() if 'gl' in t or 'multi' in t])`

---

## Phase 6B+: Parent-Child Company, Session Context & Refinements

### 6B+.0 Prerequisites

```bash
# Apply the new session_context field on Chatbot Conversation
bench --site test.local migrate

# Rebuild frontend (markdown table stripping fix)
cd apps/ai_chatbot/frontend && npm run build

# Restart bench
bench start
```

Verify session tools are registered:
```bash
bench --site test.local console
>>> from ai_chatbot.tools.registry import get_registered_tools
>>> print([t for t in get_registered_tools() if 'session' in t or 'subsidiar' in t or 'currency' in t])
# Should include set_include_subsidiaries, set_target_currency
```

---

### 6B+.1 Session Context — Include Subsidiaries

#### 6B+.1.1 Proactive Subsidiary Detection (New Chat)

1. Ensure your ERPNext has a **parent company** with at least one **child company** (Settings → Company → set `Parent Company` on the child).
2. Verify your default company: `frappe.defaults.get_user_default("Company")` — should return the parent company name.
3. Start a **new chat session** and ask any business question: `What is the total sales this month?`
4. **Expected**: Since this is the first query and the user's company has subsidiaries, the AI should **proactively ask** whether to include subsidiary data:
   > "Your company [Parent] has subsidiaries: [Child1, Child2, ...]. Would you like to include subsidiary data in your reports, or show only [Parent]?"
5. Reply: `Yes, include subsidiaries`
6. **Expected**: AI calls `set_include_subsidiaries` tool with `include=True`, confirms the setting, then proceeds to answer the original question with consolidated data.

#### 6B+.1.2 Verify Subsidiaries in Queries

1. After enabling subsidiaries (6B+.1.1), ask: `What is the total sales this month?`
2. **Expected**:
   - Response mentions **"[Parent Company] including its subsidiaries"** (the `company_label` field).
   - Revenue aggregates data from the parent AND all child companies.
   - Currency is the parent company's default currency.
   - AI does NOT ask about subsidiaries again — it uses the saved session preference.
3. Ask: `Show revenue by territory`
4. **Expected**: Grouped data includes transactions from all companies in the hierarchy.

#### 6B+.1.3 Disable Subsidiaries

1. Say: `Don't include subsidiaries` or `Exclude child companies`
2. **Expected**: AI calls `set_include_subsidiaries` with `include=False`. Confirms change.
3. Ask: `What is the total sales this month?`
4. **Expected**: Response now shows only the parent company data. Label says just the company name without "including its subsidiaries".

---

### 6B+.2 Session Context — Target Currency

#### 6B+.2.1 Set Target Currency

1. Say: `Show all amounts in USD` or mention `@USD` in your message.
2. **Expected**: AI calls `set_target_currency` with `currency="USD"`. Confirms target currency is set.
3. Ask: `What is total revenue this quarter?`
4. **Expected**: Response `currency` field shows "USD" regardless of the company's default currency.

#### 6B+.2.2 Reset Target Currency

1. Say: `Don't use target currency` or `Reset to default currency`
2. **Expected**: AI calls `set_target_currency` with `currency=None`. Confirms reset.
3. Ask: `What is total revenue this quarter?`
4. **Expected**: Response `currency` field shows the company's default currency.

#### 6B+.2.3 Company Grouping with Currency

1. Ask: `Show revenue by company` (requires multiple companies in ERPNext).
2. **Expected**: Each company's revenue is shown in its own default currency (unless target currency is set).
3. Set a target currency: `Use EUR for all amounts`
4. Ask again: `Show revenue by company`
5. **Expected**: All values shown in EUR.

---

### 6B+.3 BI Cards Display (Fix)

#### 6B+.3.1 CFO Dashboard

1. Ask: `Show CFO dashboard`
2. **Expected**: A row of 5 BI metric cards appears: Revenue, Gross Profit (with margin %), Cash Position, Receivables, Payables.

#### 6B+.3.2 Financial Overview

1. Ask: `Show financial overview`
2. **Expected**: Same 5 BI cards appear. The `get_financial_overview` tool now includes `bi_cards` in the response.

---

### 6B+.4 Duplicate Table Fix

1. Ask: `Show revenue by territory and customer`
2. **Expected**:
   - The hierarchical table appears **once** (the compact, styled `HierarchicalTable` component after the chart).
   - There should be NO raw markdown table (pipe-delimited `| ... |` format) in the text above the chart.
3. If the AI still outputs markdown text alongside, the markdown table portion should be stripped automatically — only the Vue component table renders.

---

### 6B+.5 Dimension Name Partial Matching

#### 6B+.5.1 Suffix Match

1. If you have an accounting dimension `business_vertical`:
   - Ask: `Show revenue by vertical`
   - **Expected**: Resolves `vertical` → `business_vertical` via suffix match. Returns grouped data.
2. If you have `business_segment`:
   - Ask: `Show sales by segment`
   - **Expected**: Resolves `segment` → `business_segment`.

#### 6B+.5.2 Label Word Match

1. Ask: `Show revenue by Business Vertical` (using the dimension label, not fieldname).
2. **Expected**: Resolves via label matching. Returns grouped data.

#### 6B+.5.3 Ambiguous Match

1. If you have both `business_vertical` and `custom_vertical`:
   - Ask: `Show revenue by vertical`
   - **Expected**: Returns `None` (ambiguous — multiple matches). AI should inform the user to be more specific.

---

### 6B+.6 Hierarchical Table "Particular" Column

1. Ask any grouped query: `Show revenue by territory`
2. **Expected**: The hierarchical table's first column header is **"Particular"** (not the dimension name like "Territory").
3. Ask: `Show profit by territory`
4. **Expected**: Same — first column header is "Particular".

---

### 6B+.7 Company Label in All Tool Responses

#### 6B+.7.1 Monetary Tools

1. Ask: `What are the total purchases this month?`
2. **Expected**: Response includes `company_label` field (e.g., "My Company Ltd").
3. Enable subsidiaries, then ask the same question.
4. **Expected**: `company_label` is "My Company Ltd including its subsidiaries".

#### 6B+.7.2 Non-Monetary Tools (CRM, Stock, HRMS)

1. Ask: `How many employees do we have?`
2. **Expected**: Response includes `company_label` field with company name.
3. Ask: `Show lead conversion rate`
4. **Expected**: `company_label` field present.
5. Ask: `Show low stock items`
6. **Expected**: `company_label` field present.

### 6B+.8 Session Persistence

1. Enable subsidiaries and set target currency in one conversation.
2. Switch to a different conversation.
3. Switch back to the original conversation.
4. Ask a business question.
5. **Expected**: Session context (subsidiaries + target currency) is **preserved** — settings persist because they are stored in the Chatbot Conversation DocType's `session_context` field.

### 6B+.9 Multi-Company Query Migration Verification

All 51+ tool functions across 15 modules have been migrated from `get_default_company` to `get_company_filter` for session-aware multi-company support. Test each category with subsidiaries enabled.

#### 6B+.9.1 Selling Tools

1. Enable subsidiaries: `Include subsidiary data`
2. Ask: `What are the total sales this month?`
3. **Expected**: Response aggregates sales from parent + child companies. `company_label` shows "including its subsidiaries".
4. Ask: `Who are the top 5 customers?`
5. **Expected**: Customers from all companies in the hierarchy appear.
6. Ask: `Show sales by item`
7. **Expected**: Item sales consolidated across companies.

#### 6B+.9.2 Buying Tools

1. With subsidiaries enabled, ask: `What are the total purchases this quarter?`
2. **Expected**: Purchase data from all companies. `company_label` includes subsidiary notation.
3. Ask: `Who are the top suppliers?`
4. **Expected**: Suppliers from parent and child companies combined.

#### 6B+.9.3 Finance Tools

1. Ask: `Show CFO dashboard`
2. **Expected**: All KPIs (revenue, COGS, receivables, payables, cash position) aggregate across companies.
3. Ask: `Show budget vs actual`
4. **Expected**: Budget data uses primary company (budget is per-company), actuals aggregate if subsidiaries enabled.
5. Ask: `Show cash flow statement`
6. **Expected**: Payment entries from all companies included.
7. Ask: `Show receivable aging`
8. **Expected**: Outstanding invoices from all companies.
9. Ask: `Show working capital summary`
10. **Expected**: Receivables, payables, inventory consolidated.
11. Ask: `Show financial ratios`
12. **Expected**: Ratios calculated from consolidated data.
13. Ask: `Show month over month comparison`
14. **Expected**: Monthly revenue/expenses aggregate across companies.

#### 6B+.9.4 GL Entry Tools

1. Ask: `Show trial balance`
2. **Expected**: GL balances from all companies in the hierarchy.
3. Ask: `Show account statement for Cash - [Company]`
4. **Expected**: GL entries from all companies included.

#### 6B+.9.5 Stock Tools

1. Ask: `Show low stock items`
2. **Expected**: Items from warehouses across all companies.
3. Ask: `Show stock ageing`
4. **Expected**: Stock age data from all company warehouses.

#### 6B+.9.6 HRMS Tools

1. Ask: `How many employees do we have?`
2. **Expected**: Headcount from all companies. Department breakdown includes all.
3. Ask: `Show payroll summary`
4. **Expected**: Salary slips from all companies aggregated.
5. Ask: `Show department wise salary`
6. **Expected**: Departments from all companies in pie chart.
7. Ask: `Show employee turnover`
8. **Expected**: Hires and exits across all companies.

#### 6B+.9.7 CRM Tools

1. Ask: `Show lead statistics`
2. **Expected**: Leads from all companies.
3. Ask: `Show sales funnel`
4. **Expected**: Funnel stages aggregate across companies.
5. Ask: `Show opportunity by stage`
6. **Expected**: Opportunities from all companies.

#### 6B+.9.8 Single Company Mode (Disable Subsidiaries)

1. Say: `Don't include subsidiaries`
2. Repeat any query from above (e.g., `What are the total sales this month?`)
3. **Expected**: Data is scoped to only the default company. `company_label` shows just the company name.

#### 6B+.9.9 Code-Level Verification

Run in bench console to verify no session-aware tool still uses `get_default_company`:

```bash
# Should show only: consolidation.py, operations/search.py, session.py, finance/analytics.py
cd apps/ai_chatbot && grep -rn "get_default_company" ai_chatbot/tools/ --include="*.py"
```

Verify all tool modules import `get_company_filter`:
```bash
# Should list 15 tool modules
cd apps/ai_chatbot && grep -rln "get_company_filter" ai_chatbot/tools/ --include="*.py"
```

### Troubleshooting Phase 6B+

#### Session tools not appearing

1. Verify `tools/registry.py` imports `ai_chatbot.tools.session`.
2. Run: `bench --site <SITE> console` → `from ai_chatbot.tools.registry import get_registered_tools; print([t for t in get_registered_tools()])`
3. Look for `set_include_subsidiaries` and `set_target_currency` in the output.

#### Session context not persisting

1. Check that the `session_context` field exists on Chatbot Conversation DocType:
   - `bench --site <SITE> console` → `frappe.get_meta("Chatbot Conversation").has_field("session_context")`
   - Should return `True`. If not, run `bench --site <SITE> migrate`.
2. Verify `frappe.flags.current_conversation_id` is set:
   - Check `api/chat.py` and `api/streaming.py` — both should set `frappe.flags.current_conversation_id = conversation_id` before tool execution.

#### Subsidiaries not included in queries

1. Confirm parent-child relationship in ERPNext: Company list → child company has `Parent Company` set.
2. Check `get_companies_for_query()` in console:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.core.session_context import get_companies_for_query
   print(get_companies_for_query("Parent Company Name"))
   ```
3. Verify the function returns `["Parent Company", "Child Company 1", "Child Company 2", ...]`.

#### Markdown table still showing alongside hierarchical table

1. Check `ChatMessage.vue` `renderedContent` computed property — it should strip markdown tables when `hierarchicalTables.value.length > 0`.
2. Open DevTools → Elements → inspect the message content area. Look for `<table>` elements generated by markdown rendering vs `HierarchicalTable` Vue component.

#### Dimension partial match not working

1. Run in console:
   ```python
   from ai_chatbot.data.grouping import resolve_dimension_name, _get_all_dimensions
   dims = _get_all_dimensions("Sales Invoice")
   print(dims.keys())
   print(resolve_dimension_name("vertical", dims))
   ```
2. If `None` is returned, check that `business_vertical` exists in the dimensions dict and that there are no multiple matches.
